Even though <EVENT COREFID="1">the takeover</EVENT> <EVENT COREFID="102">looks</EVENT> fairly valued, <ENTITY COREFID="15"><ENTITY COREFID="31">RBC</ENTITY> analyst Steve Arthur</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="103">said</EVENT> there is <EVENT COREFID="105">limited</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="41">upside</ENTITY> to <EVENT COREFID="104">the offer</EVENT> unless <ENTITY COREFID="42">competing bids</ENTITY> are <EVENT COREFID="106">made</EVENT> for <ENTITY COREFID="5">ATI</ENTITY>.
For <ENTITY COREFID="43">now</ENTITY>, <ENTITY COREFID="15">Arthur</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="107">said</EVENT> <EVENT COREFID="1"><ENTITY COREFID="3">AMD's</ENTITY> takeover deal, which is <EVENT COREFID="108">expected</EVENT> to <EVENT COREFID="109">close</EVENT> in <ENTITY COREFID="44">the fourth quarter</ENTITY></EVENT>, effectively <EVENT COREFID="110">offers</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="46"><ENTITY COREFID="15">his</ENTITY> one-year price target of <ENTITY COREFID="45">$21 now</ENTITY></ENTITY>.
That price target was set prior to the takeover bid and factored in ATI's gross margin leverage, capital expenditure strength, a competitive product lineup and the launch of Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people) Windows' new operating system, Vista, which would be a ``net positive'' for graphics-chips vendors.
Without a competitive bid to drive shares higher, ATI is unlikely to outperform, warranting a ``sector perform'' rating in the analyst's view.
Arthur said a competitive bid is possible but the two most-likely bidders, Intel (nasdaq:INTC - news - people) and Nvdidia, face prohibitive anti-trust challenges. Combined, ATI and Intel would have 68% overall market share in PC graphics, while an ATI-Nvidia partnership would effectively capture 100% of the discrete graphics market.
Other counteroffers could be made by Texas Instruments (nyse: TXN - news - people) and Broadcom (nasdaq: BRCM - news - people), which, according to Arthur, wouldn't so much face anti-trust challenges as they would compatibility challenges.
