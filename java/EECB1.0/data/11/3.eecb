The election of a 125-seat national legislature is the first parliamentary vote in the natural-gas rich Central Asian nation since the death of longtime autocrat Saparmurat Niyazov two years ago.
His successor, Gurbanguli Berdymukhamedov, says the election is a key step in the development of democracy.
But while the seats are contested, only one political party is legally registered in Turkmenistan, and its opponents have no foothold in politics.
The U.S. and Europe are courting Turkmenistan as they seek to diversify energy sources and were watching the vote for signs of change.
