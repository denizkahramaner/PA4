According to <ENTITY COREFID="15">this <ENTITY COREFID="19">L.A. Times</ENTITY> story</ENTITY> (which <EVENT COREFID="102">credits</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="10">the team-owned flagship radio station</ENTITY>), <ENTITY COREFID="12">the Angels</ENTITY> have made <EVENT COREFID="101">an eight-year offer</EVENT> to <ENTITY COREFID="11">free agent first baseman Mark Teixeira</ENTITY>.
The dollar amount was unspecified, but Bill Shaikin, the fine reporter who wrote the story, says the team was believed to have offered at least $160 million.
This, obviously, changes the landscape of the Teixeira sweepstakes, as the Nationals' best chance for landing him was to blow everyone else out of the water with their offer -- which, apparently, has not happened.
That's not to say the Nationals cannot sweeten their offer, but team officials have indicated an unwillingness to get into a bidding war with higher-revenue teams.
Of course, we still have yet to hear from the Red Sox -- or even the Yankees, as I hypothesized in today's print edition. 
In any case, it appears this thing is far from over.
