Regains didn't reveal the dollar amounts, but the newspaper speculates the deal is worth at least $160 million.
Teixeira is considered the top offensive player available on the free agent market, and the Orioles (seven years, $140-$150 million) and Nationals (eight years, $160 million) reportedly have made sizeable offers as well.
The Red Sox, considered to be the front-runner for Teixeira, also have put in a bid, though monetary details have been kept quiet.
There has been talk of the Yankees being in the Teixeira sweepstakes as well.
Teixeira, 28, has hit at least 30 homers and driven in at least 105 runs in each of the past five seasons.
After being acquired from the Braves before the trading deadline this past season, Teixeira hit .358 with 13 homers and 43 RBIs in 54 games with the Angels.
