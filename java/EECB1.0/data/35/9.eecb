The Chargers are due to meet Pittsburgh Steelers in a playoff match on Sunday.
Victory in that game would see them meet either Tennessee or Baltimore for a spot in next month's Super Bowl.
Jackson is enjoying the best of his four NFL seasons in the current campaign with 59 catches for 1098 yards and seven touchdowns.
``We're aware of the off-the-field issue involving Vincent,'' Chargers general manager AJ Butler said in a statement.
``Obviously we're disappointed.
We take these issues very seriously.
Moving forward, we will monitor the situation.''
