Gary Gomes, 35, will face murder and kidnapping charges after police found the bodies of two women -- 68 and 48-years-old -- inside an Independent Street apartment.
Neighbors had complained about a possible natural gas leak, which led them to the scene.
When police arrested Gomes on Tuesday night, he was barricaded inside the apartment with an unidentified person.
New Bedford Police said they will release more details about the investigation on Wednesday afternoon.
