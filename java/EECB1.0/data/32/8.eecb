The Bristol District Attorney's office said just after midnight Tuesday that 35-year-old Gary Gomes was arrested at another house where he was found barricaded with a third person.
Gomes faces arraignment in New Bedford District Court on Wednesday morning on two murder charges and one kidnapping charge.
The names of the women killed, who were 61 and 48 years old, have not been released.
Police Lt. Jeffrey Silva said the landlord's son found the bodies after entering the second-floor apartment on Tuesday afternoon to investigate the odor.
District Attorney Sam Sutter is expected to discuss the case at a news conference already planned Wednesday afternoon to discuss developments in a 2003 murder case.
