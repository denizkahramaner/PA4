Police have identified the victims as 61-year-old Katherine Gomes, mother of the suspect, and 48-year-old Robyn Mendes.
Gary Gomes was arrested late Tuesday night at 2088 Philip Street.
The D.A.'s office says Gomes was barricaded inside with a third person.
He has been charged with two counts of murder, and one count of kidnapping.
Gomes is scheduled to be arraigned in New Bedford District Court Wednesday.
The bodies of the two women were discovered on the second floor at 24 Independent Street Tuesday afternoon, after someone of the first floor smelled natural gas.
An eyewitness says the gas stove had been turned on.
