The Colts (11-4) also won their eighth straight game in defeating the Jags (5-10) who raced out to an early 14-0 lead in the game.
In fact, the Colts didn't take their first lead until former Gator defensive back Keiwan Ratliff intercepted a David Garrard pass and returned it for a touchdown to give the Colts a 31-24 lead.
The Jags drove down to the Colts 7 yard line but a pass to running back Maurice Jones-Drew was completed and he hurt his knee on the play.
The Jags had no timeouts left and by injury rule at that time a 10 second clock runoff was instituted and the game ended.
