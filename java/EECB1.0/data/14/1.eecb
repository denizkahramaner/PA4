More than 50 firefighters tackled the blaze at the store in High Street, Banstead, which broke out on the roof at about 2045 GMT on Friday.
Sixty residents were moved from their homes, while premises nearby suffered smashed windows and smoke damage.
No-one was injured in the fire, which is being treated by police as ``potentially suspicious''.
Roads in the area were closed until about 1630 GMT on Saturday.
The alarm was raised after a CCTV operator noticed smoke coming from the roof.
A statement from Waitrose said damage to the building had been extensive but the store would be rebuilt.
Surrey Police said firefighters, along with two fire tenders, and police officers would remain at the scene until Monday.
