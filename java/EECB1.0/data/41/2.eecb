Christopher Gunness from the UN Relief and Works Agency said an initial investigation left him 99.9 per cent sure there were no militants at the school.
About 1000 people were sheltering in the school after having been hounded from their homes by warfare, he said.
Mr Gunness slammed the Israeli attack on the school.
``Of course it's appalling,'' he told ABC Television from Jerusalem.
``This fighting has to stop.''
``Enough people, among them women and children, have died.''
Mr Gunness said civilian deaths were an inevitable consequence of attacking a crowded place like Gaza.
``Imagine a situation where someone says we're going to plan a massive air bombardment, but it'll be pinprick and surgical, on downtown Sydney,'' he said.
