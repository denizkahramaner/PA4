<ENTITY COREFID="21">Scott Peterson</ENTITY> has been <EVENT COREFID="1">found</EVENT> guilty of <EVENT COREFID="2">first-degree murder</EVENT>, <ENTITY COREFID="52">a verdict that <EVENT COREFID="123">means</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="21">he</ENTITY> could be <EVENT COREFID="3">executed</EVENT> if <ENTITY COREFID="10">these same jurors</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="4">vote</EVENT> as <ENTITY COREFID="53">the ``conscience of <ENTITY COREFID="54"><ENTITY COREFID="10">their</ENTITY> community</ENTITY>'' that <ENTITY COREFID="21">he</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="124">deserves</EVENT> to <EVENT COREFID="3">die</EVENT> for <EVENT COREFID="2"><ENTITY COREFID="21">his</ENTITY> crimes</EVENT></ENTITY></ENTITY>.
So <ENTITY COREFID="21">Scott Peterson</ENTITY> was <EVENT COREFID="1">convicted</EVENT> because <ENTITY COREFID="21">he's</ENTITY> a liar and a cheat and a fink and because <ENTITY COREFID="19"><ENTITY COREFID="21">his</ENTITY> famous lawyer</ENTITY> was unable to <EVENT COREFID="125">come up with</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="55">a plausible explanation for why <ENTITY COREFID="20"><ENTITY COREFID="22">Laci Peterson's</ENTITY> body</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="5">washed up</EVENT> where <ENTITY COREFID="20">it</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="5">washed up</EVENT></ENTITY>.
In fact, <ENTITY COREFID="21">he</ENTITY> was <EVENT COREFID="1">convicted</EVENT> in part because <ENTITY COREFID="15">defense attorney Mark Geragos</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="6">offered</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="59">so many explanations for <EVENT COREFID="7"><ENTITY COREFID="21">Peterson's</ENTITY> conduct</EVENT> and <EVENT COREFID="8"><ENTITY COREFID="22">Laci's</ENTITY> disappearance</EVENT> that <ENTITY COREFID="56">prosecutors</ENTITY> were able to <EVENT COREFID="126">make</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="10">jurors</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="9">laugh</EVENT> about <ENTITY COREFID="58">the implausibility of <ENTITY COREFID="57">them all</ENTITY></ENTITY></ENTITY>.
In essence, <ENTITY COREFID="10">the jury</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="1">concluded</EVENT> that <ENTITY COREFID="60">the circumstances surrounding <EVENT COREFID="127"><EVENT COREFID="8"><ENTITY COREFID="22">Laci Peterson's</ENTITY> disappearance</EVENT> and <EVENT COREFID="101">death</EVENT></EVENT></ENTITY> could not reasonably be <EVENT COREFID="128">explained</EVENT> in <ENTITY COREFID="62">any other way but that <ENTITY COREFID="21">Scott Peterson</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="129">wanted</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="22">her</ENTITY> dead so <ENTITY COREFID="21">he</ENTITY> could <EVENT COREFID="131">continue</EVENT> and perhaps <EVENT COREFID="130">expand</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="61"><ENTITY COREFID="21">his</ENTITY> secret life with <ENTITY COREFID="12">Amber Frey</ENTITY></ENTITY></ENTITY>.
<ENTITY COREFID="21">Peterson</ENTITY> was <EVENT COREFID="1">found</EVENT> guilty because <ENTITY COREFID="10">jurors</ENTITY> believed <ENTITY COREFID="21">he</ENTITY> had <ENTITY COREFID="63">a motive to <EVENT COREFID="2">kill</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="22"><ENTITY COREFID="21">his</ENTITY> wife</ENTITY></ENTITY> and that <EVENT COREFID="7"><ENTITY COREFID="21">Peterson's</ENTITY> conduct -- before, during and after <EVENT COREFID="8"><ENTITY COREFID="22">Laci Peterson's</ENTITY> disappearance</EVENT></EVENT> -- was too suspicious to be purely coincidental.
