And the legitimization of funnybooks continues, as today the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced that Wolverine himself will be hosting the 81st Academy Awards, proving once again that he's the best there is at what he does - even hosting a major awards ceremony!
Okay, so it's a bit of a stretch there, but regardless, <ENTITY COREFID="15">today</ENTITY> it was <EVENT COREFID="4">announced</EVENT> that <ENTITY COREFID="12">one of our own, Hugh Jackman</ENTITY>, will be the host of <ENTITY COREFID="42">the ceremony, <EVENT COREFID="8">televised</EVENT> live on <ENTITY COREFID="13">Sunday, February 22, 2009</ENTITY>, from <ENTITY COREFID="33">the Kodak Theatre</ENTITY> at <ENTITY COREFID="36"><ENTITY COREFID="17">Hollywood</ENTITY> & <ENTITY COREFID="16">Highland Center</ENTITY></ENTITY> on <ENTITY COREFID="11">ABC</ENTITY></ENTITY>.
While it's certainly clear that Jackman has come into his own as one of Hollywood's top leading men of both stage and screen, what us geeks know him best as is Wolverine from both the ``X-Men'' series of films as well as next year's ``X-Men Origins: Wolverine.''
In a statement released today by the Academy, producers had this to say about their choice of Jackman as the telecast's host, ``Hugh Jackman is a consummate entertainer and an internationally renowned movie star.
He also has style, elegance and a sense of occasion.
Hugh is the ideal choice to host a celebration of the year's movies - and to have fun doing it.''
