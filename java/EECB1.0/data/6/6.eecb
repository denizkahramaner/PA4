Hardwicke reportedly clashed with Summit Entertainment during Twilight's production and EW says Weitz landed the New Moon gig because he has a solid relationship with the studio, he's considered easy to work with and has experience with special effects.
In New Moon, the second novel in Stephenie Meyer's young-adult series, Bella (Kristen Stewart) recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life.
She looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward (Robert Pattinson) and his family, however, a minor accident during the festivities results in Bella's blood being shed, a sight that proves too intense for the Cullens.
They decide to leave the town of Forks, Washington for Bella and Edward's sake. Melissa Rosenberg is writing the screenplay.
Weitz co-directed American Pie, Down to Earth and About a Boy with his brother Paul.
Last year he helmed The Golden Compass, based on the Philip Pullman novel, which didn't impress North American audiences but was a hit overseas.
New Moon is tentatively scheduled to open November 20, 2009.
