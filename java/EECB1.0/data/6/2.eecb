It's official: <ENTITY COREFID="11">Chris Weitz</ENTITY> is <EVENT COREFID="2">taking over</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="11">the director's chair for <ENTITY COREFID="14">the ``<ENTITY COREFID="13">Twilight</ENTITY>'' sequel ``New Moon.''</ENTITY></ENTITY>
``Twilight`` author Stephenie Meyer confirmed the news on her official website Saturday morning in a post designed to calm the rising anguish among fans who loved the first film adaptation.
After bidding a fond farewell to ``Twilight'' director Catherine Hardwicke, Meyer went on to praise Weitz and to let fans know that ``torches and pitchforks are not going to be necessary.''
On the one hand, Weitz has shown his skill at adapting popular modern novels for the screen -- ``About a Boy,'' from the Nick Hornby novel, won Weitz and co-scripters Paul Weitz and Peter Hedges an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay.
On the other hand, Weitz also directed last year's ``The Golden Compass,'' which was an expensive mess that failed to capture the fan base of the book.
