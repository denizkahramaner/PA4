One of the quakes -- a 7.3-magnitude tremor -- was felt as far away as Australia and sent small tsunamis into Japan's southeastern coast.
Residents near the epicenter in Papua province rushed from their homes in search of higher ground shortly after the first 7.6-magnitude quake struck, afraid that huge waves might wash over the island.
The epicenter was about 85 miles from Papua's main city of Manokwari and occurred at a depth of 22 miles, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
It was followed by dozens of aftershocks.
