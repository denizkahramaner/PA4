So now we know for sure that the new Curve will be commercially available starting February, although an exact release date and a price were not given yet.
The 8900 is the thinnest BlackBerry ever built (only 13.5 mm), and it's also among the best looking smartphones to come form RIM.
Add Wi-Fi, GPS, a 3.2MP autofocus camera and a nice 480 x 360 pixels display to that and you have a really cool handset.
The only thing that the Curve 8900 is missing is 3G, but since T-Mobile doesn't have a nationwide 3G coverage yet, I guess this is not such a big problem.
While waiting for the new Berry to be available, you can enter a T-Mobile contest here, and maybe you'll win one for free.
