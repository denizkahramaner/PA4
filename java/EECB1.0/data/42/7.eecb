<ENTITY COREFID="9">T-Mobile</ENTITY> will be <EVENT COREFID="2">adding</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="8">the BlackBerry Curve 8900</ENTITY> to <ENTITY COREFID="13"><ENTITY COREFID="9">their</ENTITY> lineup</ENTITY> come <ENTITY COREFID="14">February</ENTITY>.
The press release doesn't get any more specific than that, but seems to lend authority to the previous leak, which indicated that the 18th would be the day.
