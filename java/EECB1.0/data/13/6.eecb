The fire started Friday night while a handful of people, including a women's craft group and two children, were inside Wasilla Bible Church.
No one was hurt.
The blaze is being investigated as an arson.
On Saturday, the Alaska Governor said she apologizes if the incident was in any way connected to ``undeserved negative attention'' brought on by her failed bid for the vice presidency of the United States.
Authorities believe the fire was set at the entrance of the building and moved inward before setting off a fire alarm.
Damage to the church is estimated at one-million dollars.
