<ENTITY COREFID="11">Wasilla Bible Church, the home church of <ENTITY COREFID="17"><ENTITY COREFID="15"><ENTITY COREFID="16">Alaska</ENTITY> Gov. Sarah Palin</ENTITY> and <ENTITY COREFID="25"><ENTITY COREFID="15">her</ENTITY> family</ENTITY></ENTITY></ENTITY>, received <ENTITY COREFID="14">an estimated $1 million in damage</ENTITY> from <EVENT COREFID="60">a fire that was deliberately <EVENT COREFID="54">set</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="24"><ENTITY COREFID="23">Friday</ENTITY> night</ENTITY></EVENT>.
No one was injured, but several people, including two children, were inside the church when the blaze started.
Palin spokesman Bill McAllister said that Palin told an assistant pastor she was sorry if the fire was related to the ``undeserved negative attention'' the church had received since she became the Republican vice presidential candidate earlier this year.
``Whatever the motives of the arsonist, the governor has faith in the scriptural passage that what was intended for evil will in some way be used for good,'' McAllister added.
