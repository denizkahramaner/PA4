She visited the church after the fire to apologize for any tie in with her recent national political exposure.
A ladies' crafts group was meeting in the church at the time of the fire.
``We have no idea what caused it,'' the Rev. Larry Kroon of the Wasilla Bible Church said Saturday, adding that investigators were considering arson and other possible causes.
Damage to the Wasilla Bible Church was estimated at $1 million, authorities said Saturday.
No one was injured in the fire, which was presumably set Friday night while a handful of people, including two children, were inside, according to Fire Chief James Steele.
