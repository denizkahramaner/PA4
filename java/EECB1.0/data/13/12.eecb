According to the church's minister, ``We have no idea what caused it''.
Still, it was not specified that how many people were in the building at the time of the blaze.
The metal church building, which normally accommodates Sunday congregations of up to 1,000 people, was heavily damaged by flames and smoke.
The church services would be held on schedule Sunday in a nearby school.
