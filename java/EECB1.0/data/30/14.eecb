A ship has been sent out to fix the problems.
Currently, services are being rerouted to backup cables and satellites.
As rerouting measures fully kick in, services are expected to improve by early Saturday morning.
This isn't the first time that cable service to the region has failed.
Earlier this year, five separate undersea cables were cut between late January and early February, interrupting service to a number of countries.
There's likely to be some serious failure analysis involved if we see some more pipes go off-line in the next week.
