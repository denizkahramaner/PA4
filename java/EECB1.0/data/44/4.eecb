Big Blue to Meet Its Match in HP-EDS
<ENTITY COREFID="74">The repercussions from <EVENT COREFID="1">the merger of <ENTITY COREFID="3">Electronic Data Systems (EDS Quote - Cramer on EDS - Stock Picks)</ENTITY> with <ENTITY COREFID="6">Hewlett-Packard (HPQ Quote - Cramer on HPQ - Stock Picks)</ENTITY></EVENT></ENTITY> will <EVENT COREFID="143">ripple</EVENT> broadly throughout <ENTITY COREFID="75">the tech industry</ENTITY>.
<ENTITY COREFID="6">H-P</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="2">announced</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="31">Tuesday</ENTITY> that <ENTITY COREFID="6">it</ENTITY> will <EVENT COREFID="1">buy</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="3">the outsourcing services company</ENTITY> for <ENTITY COREFID="8">$13.9 billion</ENTITY>.
<ENTITY COREFID="39">The deal</ENTITY> will be bad ``for <ENTITY COREFID="20">anyone that doesn't <EVENT COREFID="144">have</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="6">H-P</ENTITY> or <ENTITY COREFID="7">IBM (IBM Quote - Cramer on IBM - Stock Picks)</ENTITY> on <ENTITY COREFID="76"><ENTITY COREFID="20">their</ENTITY> business card</ENTITY></ENTITY>,'' <EVENT COREFID="145">said</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="26"><ENTITY COREFID="25">IDC</ENTITY> analyst Bob Welch</ENTITY>.
Even IBM, the leader in the global services and outsourcing business, will ultimately feel the pressure. Gartner puts the worldwide market for IT services in 2007 at $748 billion.
With $54 billion in services revenue, IBM had 7.2% of the market. 
At $22 billion, EDS had 3%, while H-P had 2.3%.
And <EVENT COREFID="1">the merger</EVENT> could <EVENT COREFID="146">throw a wrench into</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="83"><ENTITY COREFID="3">EDS's</ENTITY> Agility Alliance, a group of vendors that regularly <EVENT COREFID="148">coordinate</EVENT> to <EVENT COREFID="147">supply</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="82"><ENTITY COREFID="78">hardware</ENTITY>, <ENTITY COREFID="79">networking</ENTITY>, <ENTITY COREFID="80">software</ENTITY> and <ENTITY COREFID="81">services</ENTITY></ENTITY> to <ENTITY COREFID="77"><ENTITY COREFID="3">EDS's</ENTITY> outsourcing clients</ENTITY></ENTITY>.
The partnership has been very effective for EDS and its partners, Welch said.
