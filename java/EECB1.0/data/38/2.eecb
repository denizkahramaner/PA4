According to the USGS, the area has no fault, but the pumping of water from plants into the ground periodically induces small temblors.
The size of Sunday morning's earthquake caught the attention of people in Cobb, a small community along Highway 175 in Lake County, 4 miles east of The Geysers.
``Shaking isn't uncommon here, but this was a pretty good jolt,'' said James Gaskell, manager of Hardester's grocery.
The only products to fall off shelves were Q-Tip boxes and mayonnaise, but ``our wine rattled pretty good.''
Down the road at Brick Oven Pizza, which opens for breakfast on weekends, ``it caught our attention,'' said Geri Angel, a waitress.
``We have teacup rattlers all the time, but pans were swinging for this one.''
