Microsoft usually releases patches on a set schedule and this is only the third emergency patch in the last three years.
The flaw has been in circulation since the first week of December.
So far, more than two million computers are believed to have been infected, according to PC Magazine.
The vulnerabilities are found on copies of Internet Explorer 7, as well as IE6 and IE5.
The patch is designed to prevent attackers from downloading malware onto users' computers if they visit a malicious Web site, or a legitimate Web site that has been infected.
