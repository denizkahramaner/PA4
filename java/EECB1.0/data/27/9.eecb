The flaw could allow hackers to take control of computers and steal passwords and credit card information.
Writing in a company blog, Mike Reavey, director of the Microsoft Security Response Center, urged users to test and deploy the security update ``as quickly as possible.''

Users can now download it for their home computers or laptops from Microsoft Update website.
Microsoft security experts estimated earlier that roughly 0.2 percent of IE users worldwide may have been exposed to websites containing exploits of the latest vulnerability, which means millions of users are in danger of having their computers infected.
Latest statistics from research firm Net Applications showed that IE still dominates the browser market with a share of nearly 70 percent.
