Constable Tim Fanning said Eric Allen Kirkpatrick, who had recently been fired from his job, is accused of fatally shooting Benjamin David Banky, 40.
Fanning said at least a dozen people were at the party when the gunman entered about 4 p.m.
All but Kirkpatrick escaped without injury.
``Police locked down the neighborhood and negotiated with the suspect, who gave himself up to police just after 6: 00 p.m.,'' Fanning said in a statement.
The business at the location of the shooting is listed as TallGrass Distribution Ltd., a natural health product supplier.
