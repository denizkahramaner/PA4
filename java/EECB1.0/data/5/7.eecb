The 2008-09 season was supposed to be a good one for the Sixers, who claimed the summer's top free agent prize in Elton Brand and then assured that their big three would be together long-term by re-signing Anre Iguodala.
Unfortunately, it hasn't played out that way to date.
Currently sitting at 9-14 on the season, the only thing stopping Philly from being complete buried in the standings is that so many Eastern Conference teams are struggling, as well.
Despite their poor start and their current three-game losing streak - likely to end tonight as the team takes on the Wizards - the Sixers are still just two games in the loss column behind the eighth seed in the East.
Cheeks marks the third Eastern Conference head coach to get fired this season, following in the footsteps of the Toronto Raptors' Sam Mitchell and the Washington Wizards' Eddie Jordan.
Cheeks will be succeeded by Assistant GM Tony DiLeo.
