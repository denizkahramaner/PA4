Expected to contend for a division title after the addition of Elton Brand, the Sixers (9-14) are instead last in the Atlantic after losing eight of their last 10 games.
An 88-72 road loss to the Cavaliers in Cleveland Friday was apparently the last straw, though the team has not enjoyed a winning season under Cheeks in his previous three years at the helm.
They had been on the verge of a resurgence as December started, improving their record to 7-6 before hitting a slump to fall to dead last in the division.
Assistant general manager Tony DiLeo was appointed interim coach as the Sixers get ready for a game against Washington Saturday night.
Cheeks is 284-286 lifetime, including four years in Portland.
