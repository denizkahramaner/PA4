<ENTITY COREFID="11">Maurice Cheeks</ENTITY> has been <EVENT COREFID="1">fired</EVENT> as head coach of <ENTITY COREFID="12">the Philadelphia 76ers</ENTITY> following <ENTITY COREFID="24"><ENTITY COREFID="12">the club's</ENTITY> disappointing <ENTITY COREFID="22">9-14</ENTITY> start to <ENTITY COREFID="14">the season</ENTITY></ENTITY>.
The Sixers have dropped their last three and are just 2-8 in their last ten after high expectations following an offseason that brought Elton Brand to Philly.
Cheeks had signed an extension to his contract in September that was guaranteed through next year but the club felt they needed to make a change to reverse their fortunes.
Assistant general manager Tony DiLeo will replace Cheeks as the interim head coach and he is expected to hold the position through the year.
Philadelphia fans had expected the 76ers to be a contender this year following a playoff appearance one year ago and then adding Brand.
