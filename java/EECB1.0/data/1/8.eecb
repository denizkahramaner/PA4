Oh, it's been so long since we were on the rehab beat!
After <EVENT COREFID="6">telling</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="27">People</ENTITY> in October that <ENTITY COREFID="23">she</ENTITY> didn't ``need to do any of that anymore,'' <ENTITY COREFID="23">``<ENTITY COREFID="21">American Pie</ENTITY>'' actress and former travel reporter Tara Reid</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="3">checked into</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="28">Promises Treatment Center</ENTITY> on <ENTITY COREFID="35">Friday</ENTITY> for <ENTITY COREFID="29">an unspecified problem</ENTITY>.
Promises is a celeb favorite favored by Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan -- it's also where Mel Gibson retired to after his 2006 accident and anti-Semitic outburst.
Not quite the Christmas alternative we're looking for...
Get well soon, Tara!
