It is unclear what she is being treated for.
'Tara Reid has checked herself into the Promises Treatment Center,' her rep says in a statement.
'We appreciate your respect to her and her family's privacy at this time.'
Tara, 33, was previously engaged to MTV host Carson Daly in 2001.
But they called it off only months before their wedding.
She is currently dating her business partner Julien Jarmoune, 34.
