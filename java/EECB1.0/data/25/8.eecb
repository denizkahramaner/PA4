New Orleans signed CB Michael Lehan, who spent five games with the Dolphins this season, to take the vacant roster spot.
Bush played in 10 games, but had to sit out four straight after he underwent knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus in October.
He rushed 106 times for 404 yards and two touchdowns and also had 52 catches for 440 yards and four TDs. He also had three punt returns for scores.
