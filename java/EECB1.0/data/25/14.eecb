The decision was made after Bush met with Dr. James Andrews this past week.
Bush injured his left knee on Oct. 19 and had arthroscopic surgery to fix a torn meniscus and missed four games.
He was bothered by the knee last week against the Bears and didn't play in the second half.
Pierre Thomas will get most of the carries and is an excellent play against the Lions this week.
