Saints could shut down Reggie Bush?
<ENTITY COREFID="26">The Biloxi Sun Herald</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="12">suggests</EVENT> that <ENTITY COREFID="15">Reggie Bush <ENTITY COREFID="13">(knee)</ENTITY></ENTITY> could be <EVENT COREFID="1">shut down</EVENT> for <ENTITY COREFID="27">the remainder of <ENTITY COREFID="20"><ENTITY COREFID="23">the Saints'</ENTITY> season</ENTITY></ENTITY>.
Beat writer Larry Holder puts this in a one liner, saying Bush ``could sit out the final two games.''
It may be speculative, or Holder has reasoning behind it that he doesn't give.
We'll know more about Bush Wednesday, when the Saints practice and hopefully reveal the results of his MRI.
