According to reports in an Atlanta newspaper:
Nichols was sentenced Saturday morning to seven life sentences and four sentences of life without parole plus 485 years.
Nichols was being tried for rape in March 2005 when he overpowered a female sheriff's deputy, took her gun and shot the judge in his rape trial and the court reporter.
Outside the courtroom, Nichols shot and killed a sheriff's deputy sergeant.
Later that day, as he attempted to elude police, he shot and killed a U.S. Customs agent.
He later made it to Gwinnett County where he kidnapped a woman who says she talked Nichols into surrendering.
