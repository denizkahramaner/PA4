Anthony Phillip LaSalle was also charged Friday with three counts of criminal vehicular homicide.
LaSalle is expected to appear in court next Monday.
Police say 66-year-old LuAnn Marie Johnson, of Burnsville, was killed Wednesday night when she was struck twice by LaSalle's car outside the store.
Authorities say the 36-year-old LaSalle had a blood alcohol level of 0.41%.
That's more than five times the legal limit. 
Police say they had to Taser him to get him out of his car, and that he told them he fled because he had drank a half-liter of vodka before driving to the store.
