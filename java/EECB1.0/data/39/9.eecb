<ENTITY COREFID="8">26-year-old Matt Smith</ENTITY> has been <EVENT COREFID="2">cast</EVENT> as the next incarnation of <ENTITY COREFID="11">the Doctor</ENTITY>.
Users on the Facebook Doctor Who forum that I frequent mostly had the same reaction: ``Who's Matt Smith?''
<ENTITY COREFID="8">The guy</ENTITY> is relatively unknown and <ENTITY COREFID="38">the skeptics</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="119">wondered</EVENT> if <ENTITY COREFID="37">the right person</ENTITY> was <EVENT COREFID="4">chosen</EVENT>.
After all, everyone speculated that Paterson Joseph, who had appeared on a couple episodes of the show, was going to be the next Doctor and here we get some no-name.
