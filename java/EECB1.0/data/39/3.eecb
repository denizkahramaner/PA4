<ENTITY COREFID="7">Tennant</ENTITY> has now been <EVENT COREFID="113">voted</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="7">one of the most popular Doctors of <ENTITY COREFID="31">all time</ENTITY></ENTITY> and is <EVENT COREFID="3">handing</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="32"><ENTITY COREFID="7">his</ENTITY> sonic screwdriver</ENTITY> over to <ENTITY COREFID="8">actor Matt Smith</ENTITY>.
Of course, there has been a media frenzy, with practically every national tabloid screaming ``Who??''.
But <EVENT COREFID="2">the casting of <ENTITY COREFID="8">Smith</ENTITY></EVENT> is a stroke of genius: <ENTITY COREFID="8">he</ENTITY> will not <EVENT COREFID="114">bring</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="33">any ``star personality''</ENTITY> with <ENTITY COREFID="8">him</ENTITY> that perhaps <ENTITY COREFID="34">a ``name''</ENTITY> would <EVENT COREFID="114">have</EVENT>, but <ENTITY COREFID="8">he</ENTITY> <EVENT COREFID="115">seems</EVENT> utterly <EVENT COREFID="116">committed</EVENT>, and <ENTITY COREFID="35">I</ENTITY> have to <EVENT COREFID="117">say</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="8">he</ENTITY> does <EVENT COREFID="118">have</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="36">an other-worldly look</ENTITY> to <ENTITY COREFID="8">him</ENTITY>.
