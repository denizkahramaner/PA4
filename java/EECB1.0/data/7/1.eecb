After flooring Rahman in the sixth round with a left-right combo Klitschko wasted little time wrapping it up in the seventh with a big left-right-left series that led to the referee stepping in and stopping the fight at the 2:15 mark.
Rahman, a former heavyweight champion who shocked the world when he floored Lennox Lewis in 2001 for the title, showed absolutely no signs of life against Kiltschko on Saturday.
The final numbers showed Klitschko landing 178 of 369 punches thrown while Rahman connected on just 30 of 207 punches thrown.
