The reigning national player of the year finished 7-for-14 from the field and had nine rebounds for North Carolina (10-0), which shook off a slow start and stretched the lead to double figures shortly after Hansbrough passed Phil Ford for the record midway through the first half.
Ford, now an assistant coach with the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats, finished his career in 1978 with 2,290 points.
Hansbrough, who needed nine points coming in, tied Ford on a jumper from the left wing with 14:05 left in the first half.
