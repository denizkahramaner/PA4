Ford, now an assistant coach to fellow Tar Heel alumnus Larry Brown with the NBA Charlotte Bobcats, finished his career in 1978 with 2,290 points.
As soon as the record-setting shot went through the net, officials briefly stopped the game to allow Ford, coach Roy Williams and athletic director Dick Baddour to present Hansbrough with the game ball.
``I never dreamed I'd be here and be the all-time leading scorer,'' Hansbrough said as he stood alone at midcourt after the game.
``This is a great honor to be here and to represent you guys every night in this uniform.''
Shy Ely scored 23 points for the Purple Aces.
