The Indians say the pirates were from Somalia and Yemen, two countries on the coast of the Gulf.
Also, a German naval helicopter thwarted another attack today on a freighter being chased by speedboats off Yemen.
Both ships that were targeted by the pirates are said to be Ethiopian.
Somali pirates recently seized a Saudi supertanker loaded with $100 million of crude oil.
Also, the threat of pirates recently prompted a German cruise ship to evacuate some 420 passengers and crew after the company decided not to risk their safety as the ship passed through the Gulf of Aden.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is set to ask the U.N. to authorize ``all necessary measures'' against the increasingly bold Somalian pirates.
