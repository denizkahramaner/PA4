<ENTITY COREFID="24">The Indian navy</ENTITY> has <EVENT COREFID="2">captured</EVENT> <ENTITY COREFID="11">23 Somalian pirates</ENTITY>.
The pirates were about to board a vessel in the Gulf of Aden when they were apprehended.
Last month, India's navy drew criticism after sinking a Thai fishing trawler that had been commandeered hours earlier by pirates, but the navy says it fired in self-defence.
Somali pirates have become increasingly brazen, and recently seized a Saudi supertanker loaded with e75m worth of crude oil.
